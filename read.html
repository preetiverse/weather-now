            <h1>How climate change affects extreme weather around the world</h1>

            <h2><i>In the early 2000s, a new field of climate-science research emerged that began to explore
                    the human fingerprint on extreme weather, such as floods, heatwaves, droughts and storms.</i></h2>

            <p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; font-size: 20px;">
                Known as “extreme event attribution”, the field has gained momentum, not only in the science world,
                but also in the media and public imagination. These studies have the power to link the seemingly
                abstract
                concept of climate change with personal and tangible experiences of the weather.
                <br>
                Scientists have published more than 350 peer-reviewed studies looking at weather extremes around the
                world, from
                heatwaves in Sweden and droughts in South Africa to flooding in Bangladesh and hurricanes in the
                Caribbean. The
                result is mounting evidence that human activity is raising the risk of some types of extreme weather,
                especially
                those linked to heat.
                <br>
                To track how the evidence on this fast-moving topic is stacking up, Carbon Brief has mapped to the
                best of our
                knowledge - every extreme-weather attribution study published to date.

                Carbon Brief's analysis reveals:
                <br>
                - 70% of the 405 extreme weather events and trends included in the map were found to be made more likely
                or
                more severe by human-caused climate change.
                <br>
                9% of events or trends were made less likely or less severe by climate change, meaning 79% of all
                events
                experienced some human impact. The remaining 21% of events and trends showed no discernible human
                influence or were inconclusive.
                <br>
                Of the 122 attribution studies that have looked at extreme heat around the world, 92% found that
                climate
                change made the event or trend more likely or more severe.
                <br>
                For the 81 studies looking at rainfall or flooding, 58% found human activity had made the event more
                likely
                or more severe. For the 69 drought events studied, it's 65%.

                First published in July 2017, this article is the fourth annual update (see endnote) to incorporate new
                studies.
                The aim is that it serves as a tracker for the evolving field of “extreme event attribution”.
            </p>

            <h2>Using the map</h2>
            <p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; font-size: 20px;">
                The map above shows 405 extreme weather events and trends across the globe for which scientists
                have carried out attribution studies. The different symbols show the type of extreme weather;
                for example, a heatwave, flood or drought. The colours indicate whether the attribution study
                found a link to human-caused climate change (red), no link (blue) or was inconclusive (grey).


            </p>

            <img class="upper" src="images\article1.png">
            <p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; font-size: 20px;">
                Use the plus and minus buttons in the top-left corner, or double click anywhere, to zoom in on
                any part of the world. Click on a symbol to reveal more information, including a quote from the
                original paper to summarise the findings and a link to the online version.
                <br>
                The filter on the left allows users to select a specific type of weather event to look at or, for
                example, only
                those found to be influenced by climate change.
                <br>
                The filter can also be used to highlight extreme events from a particular year. (Note: previous versions
                of this

                map classified events by the year that the study or analysis was published.)
                <br>
                The software used to make the map currently only works with a Web Mercator projection (as used by
                virtually all
                major online map providers). It is worth noting that this - like all map projections - offers a somewhat
                distorted
                view of the world.
                <br>
                It is important to note that the weather events scientists have studied so far are not randomly chosen.
                They can be
                high-profile events, such as Hurricane Harvey, or simply the events that occurred nearest to scientific
                research
                centres. (More on this below.)
                <br>

                The map includes three different types of studies. The circles and hexagons on the map indicate papers
                published
                in peer-reviewed journals. The different shapes refer to whether the study considers an individual
                extreme event
                (circles), such as a wildfire or storm, or whether it analyses longer-term trends in extreme weather
                (hexagons),
                such as the change in frequency of flooding or marine heatwaves over time.
                <br>
                The third shape - triangles - indicate rapid attribution studies. These are quickfire assessments of the
                climate
                change contribution to extreme weather events, published online shortly after an event concludes. (More
                on this
                below.)
                <br>
                Finally, it is worth noting that some of the icon locations are approximate - particularly for studies
                that cover
                large regions. For example, global studies can be found grouped together in the middle of the Atlantic
                Ocean.
            </p>



            <h2>
                Human influence on extreme weather
            </h2>
            <p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; font-size: 20px;">




                For the majority of events affected by climate change, the balance has shifted in the same direction.
                That is,
                rising temperatures made the event in question more severe or more likely to occur. These events are
                represented
                by the red in the chart below. Clicking on the red “slice” reveals that heatwaves account for 43% of
                such events,
                rainfall or flooding for 17%, and droughts for 16%. Return to the original chart, and do the same with
                the other
                slices to see the proportion of different weather types in each category.
                <br>
                In 10% of extreme weather events and trends studied, scientists found no discernible influence from
                human activity. These are coloured blue in the map and the chart above. For a further 11%, the
                observational data or modelling techniques used in the study were insufficient to reach a reliable
                conclusion (shown as grey in the map and pie chart).
                <br>
                In 9% of studied weather events and trends, scientists found climate change had made the event less
                likely or
                less severe (pale orange in the chart above).
                <br>
                Unsurprisingly, this category includes blizzards and extreme cold snaps. However, it also features a few
                studies
                that suggest climate change has lessened the chances of heavy rainfall, and another that found rising
                temperatures
                have made agricultural drought in California less likely.
                <br>
                Drought is complicated (more on this below). Briefly, though, it is worth noting that five other studies
                looking
                at different aspects of the California drought over 2011-17 found climate change had played a role. Two
                found no
                discernible link (pdf, p7-15), while one was inconclusive (pdf, p3).
                <br>
                Interestingly, a 2020 study analysed the way links between climate change and the California drought
                were portrayed
                US media. It finds that the links were “covered widely in both local and national news”, but notes:

                <br><br>
                <i>“However, legitimate differences in the methods underpinning the attribution studies performed by
                    different
                    researchers often resulted in a frame of scientific uncertainty or disagreement in the media
                    coverage.”</i><br>
